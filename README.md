# rust-blockchain
A simple blockchain built in Rust, implementing SHA-256 hashing, block validation, and chain integrity checks. 

## 🚀 Features  
- Automatically generates a **Genesis Block** (first block).  
- Uses **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing** for block integrity.  
- Supports adding new **transaction blocks** dynamically.  
- Implements **blockchain validation** to ensure correctness.  
- Displays the blockchain in a structured, human-readable format.
